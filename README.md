- Want to wait for a child of `Workspace` named "Jonathon"?  
  `Waiter.waitFor.child(workspace, {Name = "Jonathon"})`
- Want to collect all the important elements of a menu into one table?  
  `Waiter.collect.descendants(Menu, {RespawnButton = {Tag = "respawn_button}, MainMenuButton = {Tag = "main_menu_button"})`
